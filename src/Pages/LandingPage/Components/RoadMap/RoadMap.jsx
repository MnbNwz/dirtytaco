        <h1>Why DT-NFT? </h1>
        <p>The birth of this project came from several discussions. Being part of the NFT community for a long time now, we noticed the lack of any real utility when it comes to NFTs in general. we want to remediate this by becoming the NFT pioneers in the area(ny)while also doing something that elevates NFTs themselves. We also want to be the first ones in the food and restaurant industry to implement blockchain technology in the area. </p>
        <p>Our vision is to create an exclsuive Dirty Taco VIP club where everyone has the chance to make money together, but also get their money's value via our exclusive services and perks, above all we want to create a family and be closer to our clientele. </p>  
        <p>We strongly believe NFTs will change the restaurant industry, and we are priviliged to be in a position to act on this belief and pioneer blockchain technology integration in our industry and community. We choose to run our discord server just the way we run each and every Dirty Taco location! With love and a1ppreciation! </p>
